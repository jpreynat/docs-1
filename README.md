# Install

Make sure you have Python and pip

```pip install mkdocs-material```

When in the root of the repo type:

```mkdocs serve```

Any changes made in the docs will reload immediately in browser

To develop docs faster, use `mkdocs serve --dirtyreload` - this won't build the search index and a handful of other things, but will make it far less annoying to wait for each little change to build the whole stack
